### 4. Improvements
```1)in the future we would improve this app by implementing passworless auth utilizing Sendgrid api, check this    article:```
```  https://www.prisma.io/blog/backend-prisma-typescript-orm-with-postgresql-auth-mngp1ps7kip4   ```

```2)the above could be used in combination of auth0 api,```
```  saving user profiles in a remote server like auth0, as well as in our local db, is a good idea```

```3)also i recommend implementing Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF or XSRF):```
```  https://docs.nestjs.com/security/csrf```

```4)for more diverse application, authorization based on Roles will be required:```
```  https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authorization```

### 5. API documentation
```the app has three sepereate controllers : appController, ToDoCntroller, UserController```

```steps:```
```1)userController.signup >>>> create user (signup)```
```2.1)appController.signIn >>>get access_token (sigin)```
```2.2)appController.self >>> use access_token to get current user info/profile```
```2.3)use this format in header.Authorization: "Beare acess_token" to access protected paths that are using JwtAuthGuard```
```4)similarly using access_token you can access rest of the api ends point wich are now limited to ToDOController```
```toDoCOntroller contains CRUD APi ends points for toDo table```
### use swagger tool for furthor api documentation
```http://localhost:3000/api```
